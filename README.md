# Infinity.3d
“Infinity.3D”, a new open-source tool for the interactive three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of nu-merical ensemble weather predictions. The tool has been developed to support weather forecasting during aircraft-based atmospheric field campaigns however, it is applicable to further forecasting, research and teaching activities. His work approaches challenging topics related to the visual analysis of numerical atmospheric model output 3-D visualization, ensemble visualization and how both can be used in a meaningful way suited to weather forecasting. Infinity.3D builds a bridge from proven 2-D visualization methods commonly used in meteorology to 3-D visualization by combining both visualization types in a 3-D context. The issue of spatial perception in the 3-D view and present approaches to using the ensemble to allow the user to assess forecast
